sickbot
=======
Python Twitter bot that uses basic Bayesian filtering to identify whether or not tweeters are sick. Could be fun in the future to implement a cooler ML algorithm for stronger results. By Alex Rablau and Harry Davis. 

Dependencies: Tweepy 

Note: May need to restart main between training and running due to limitations of Twitter's Streaming API.
